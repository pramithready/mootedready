                This project is a social media app for Greek Life on UCSD campus. Users can login with their organization and keep track of private updates as well as
                publicly post to a feed about upcoming fundraisers and public events. Additionally, users can invite other organizations to parties and exchanges, and each 
                user gets a push notification when this occurs. Built in Swift and backed by Google Firebase.

                This app is being developed for a startup in the Basement, an incubator on UCSD campus. The app provides a service similar to Uber Eats and Postmates, 
                except it is Peer-to-Peer. Students can make their own food and post it on our app, and other students can browse the app and purchase homemade food from
                students right here on campus. We are targeting a release date of Fall Quarter.

            <p class="para1">As part of the project team, TSE is developing a mobile app for the International Health Collective. It is focused on mental health and wellness and comprises of a daily check-in for data points such as mood, hours of sleep, and more. Once the user checks in, they receive in-app currency they can use to 
            grow and take care of a plant object. The idea is that as the user takes care of the fictional plant, they simultaneously take care of their mental health. </p>

              runs algorithms on the huge amounts of untapped data sports has to try and make the process of drafting, scouting, and coaching more streamlined. Specifically,
