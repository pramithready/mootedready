        <h1> Pramith Reddy</h1> <br/>
        <p>Hey there! I'm a third year undergraduate at UC San Diego pursuing a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Business.
        <br/> <small>Here are some things that are important to me!</small></p>

        <div id="friends-col-1">
            <h3>Friends + Family</h3>
            <div class="text-box">
                I'm from the SF Bay Area and grew up in Fremont. I love spending time with my friends and family from back home,
                as well as all the new friends I've made in San Diego. Whether it's watching TV, playing video games, or just
                generally hanging out, I know I'll always have a good time with my family and friends.

            <h3>Fitness</h3>
            <div class="text-box">
                I prioritized fitness from a very young age, and have always loved being active. I played little league baseball
                as a child, and practiced Tae Kwon Do for 11 years, until I was 17 years old. In high school, I ran cross country
                and track for the school team. These days, I can't run like I used to, but I've been staying active by going to
                the gym and rock climbing. I'm patiently waiting for the climbing gyms to reopen so I can get back to that. In the
                meantime, the gym and the occasional run keep me active.

        <div id="food-col-1">
            <h3>Food</h3>
            <div class="text-box">
                Everybody likes food, and I guess I'm no different. Going to school in San Diego has been an absolute blessing because
                it opened my eyes to some life-changing Mexican food. I'm a huge fan of the California Burrito at Don Carlos and
                the Adobado Tacos at Tacos El Gordo. I've also started cooking a lot more, and really enjoy the process of preparing
                my own food. I used to watch a lot of Food Network as a kid, so I'm finally putting that knowledge to use. I mainly
                enjoy making different kinds of pastas, since they're the perfect blend of simple, yet fulfilling food.

            <h3>Football</h3>
            <div class="text-box">
                Honestly I love almost all sports, but I just wanted to follow with the 'F' theme. That begin said, football is definitely my favorite
                sport, and I'm a huge Patriots fan. Super Bowl 51 was one of the greatest days of my life, and that 28-3 comeback will
                never be forgotten. I also love playing fantasy football with my friends, and I've won our league once. I pour countless
                hours towards research for my fantasy team (a generally fruitless task) in efforts to get another championship.
